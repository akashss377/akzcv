            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented BSc Computer Science student with a strong foundation in software
                development, algorithms, and data structures. My academic journey has equipped me with skills in
                programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, as well as experience with databases, web development,
                and problem-solving. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and contribute
                effectively to the growth of an innovative tech company.
